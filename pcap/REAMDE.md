### 🔍 Analysis Instructions
To view and analyze this evidence, you will need a dedicated packet analysis tool.

1.  **Tool Recommendation:** I recommend using **Wireshark**, the industry-standard network protocol analyzer.
2.  **Verification:** Before opening the file, verify the forensic integrity by comparing the file's SHA-256 hash against the value provided in the [hashes.txt](./hashes.txt) file in this directory.
3.  **Loading the Capture:** * Launch Wireshark.
    * Go to **File > Open** and select the downloaded `.pcap` file.
    * Use the display filters provided in the main project documentation to isolate the infection lifecycle (e.g., `http` or `ip.addr == 160.9.3.101`).
